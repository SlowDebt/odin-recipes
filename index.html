    <p>You can easily lighten up lasagna and save a decent amount of dollars by using 
        cottage cheese instead of ricotta â€” you still get that same taste and comfort, but it's 
        not as overwhelmingly filling and can be much easier to digest for people with minor dairy 
        sensitivities. Blend the cottage cheese with a mixer beforehand so it'll have a consistency 
        closer to ricotta.</p>

            in your pantry and fridge at this very moment. It's simple, quick, and kid-friendly, and it's 
            a perfect contender for your next weeknight family dinner.</p>
